# AI-Driven Hurricane Modeling Framework

## Philosophy

Physics-guided learning over purely data-driven models.

## Core Ideas

- Embed physical constraints in loss functions
- Use non-dimensional scaling as input features
- Hybrid parametric + ML wind models
- Distributed training for ensemble generation

## Vision

Toward coupled Earth-system foundation models for hazard forecasting.
