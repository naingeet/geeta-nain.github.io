# Hurricane Wind Structure Modeling

## Research Objective

Develop physically consistent parametric representations of hurricane wind fields.

## Methods

- Rmax and R17 structural diagnostics
- Non-dimensional wind scaling
- Rossby parameter influence analysis
- TCF regime classification

## Ongoing Work

- Bias correction across storm regimes
- Structural evolution clustering
- AI-enhanced wind reconstruction
